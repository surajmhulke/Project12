Certainly, let's dive into a detailed algorithm for Adaboost Regression (specifically Adaboost R2). We'll cover the key steps along with formulas and explanations:

### Adaboost R2 Algorithm:

#### 1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize data point weights uniformly: \( w_i = \frac{1}{N} \), where \( N \) is the total number of data points.
   - Initialize an ensemble of weak regressors.

#### 2. **For Each Iteration:**
   a. **Train Weak Regressor:**
      - Train a weak regressor (e.g., decision tree stump) on the data with the current weights.

   b. **Make Predictions:**
      - Obtain predictions using the weak regressor.

   c. **Calculate Weighted Squared Error:**
      - Calculate the weighted squared error for each data point:
         \[ \text{Weighted Squared Error}_i = w_i \cdot (\text{Actual}_i - \text{Prediction}_i)^2 \]

   d. **Calculate Total Weighted Squared Error:**
      - Calculate the total weighted squared error:
         \[ \text{Total Weighted Squared Error} = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \text{Weighted Squared Error}_i \]

   e. **Compute Learner Weight:**
      - Compute the learner weight based on the total weighted squared error:
         \[ \text{Learner Weight} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1 - \text{Total Weighted Squared Error}}{\text{Total Weighted Squared Error}}\right) \]

   f. **Update Weights:**
      - Update the weights of data points:
         \[ w_i = w_i \cdot \exp\left(-\text{Learner Weight} \cdot (\text{Actual}_i - \text{Prediction}_i)\right) \]

   g. **Normalize Weights:**
      - Normalize the weights:
         \[ w_i = \frac{w_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i} \]

#### 3. **Final Prediction:**
   - Combine weak regressors' predictions using their respective weights:
      \[ \text{Final Prediction} = \sum_{\text{Weak Regressors}} \left( \text{Learner Weight} \cdot \text{Weak Regressor Prediction} \right) \]

### Additional Considerations:

#### Loss Function:
- Adaboost R2 typically uses the squared error loss function, emphasizing the difference between predicted and actual values.

#### Bucketing:
- Bucketing is not a standard part of Adaboost R2. The algorithm focuses on refining predictions rather than categorizing them into buckets.

#### Normalization:
- Weights are normalized to ensure they sum to 1, maintaining the probabilistic interpretation.

#### Up-Sampling:
- Up-sampling is not a standard part of Adaboost R2. However, the weights update process adjusts emphasis on misclassified points, achieving a similar effect.

In summary, Adaboost R2 iteratively trains weak regressors, updating data point weights based on their errors, and combines their predictions to form a robust regression model. It differs from the classification version primarily in the loss function and the nature of predictions.
